Difference between Array and collections framework-->

Arrays ---> Arrays can store primitive and non primitive types of data
       ---> Arrays can store only homogenous types of data means same type of data
       ---> Arrays size is fixed we cannot increase or decrease the size of array at runtime
       ---> Arrays are inbuilt features of java and thus we have to develop algorithms

Collection framework ---> They can store only non primitive types of data     
                     ---> We can store hetrogenous type of data means different type of data 
                     ---> We can increase or decrease the size of collections at runtime 
                     ---> Collection framework is an api which provides pre defined classes interfaces and methods
